# Pachinkremental by Poochy.EXE

Pachinkremental is a pachinko-based incremental browser game. It's designed for Firefox or Chrome on desktop, although it seems to run noticeably smoother in Chrome than Firefox. The UI will probably be rather clunky on mobile, but otherwise the game appears to run fine on mobile devices in both Safari and Chrome.

## How to play

Click anywhere in the drop zone (the green box at the top of the board) to drop a ball.

Click on the "Upgrades", "Stats", and "Options" headers to expand or collapse them.

Hover the mouse cursor over an upgrade button and a tooltip will pop up to tell you what it does.

The rest is for you to discover as you progress!

## FAQs

### Q: Why does the drop zone flash red and green?

A: The drop zone is green when you can drop another ball, and red when you've reached the maximum number of balls allowed on the board at once.

Once you upgrade your auto-drop delay, the drop zone will stop turning red, to avoid really ugly rapid flashing between red and green.

### Q: The balls pass right through each other! Is this a bug?

A: This is intentional, both to make sure the game won't softlock with too many balls clogging up the board and to avoid draining batteries by making the collision detection code too performance-intensive. If you really must, pretend this is a very deep board and the balls are passing in front of or behind each other.

### Q: Will there be a Prestige/New Game+ mechanic?

A: I'm not saying it'll never happen, but I currently have no plans to add a prestige mechanic. I designed this game around discovering new features and mechanics as the main fun factor, drawing inspiration from games like Candy Box. I've yet to come up with a way to fit a prestige mechanic into that vision. But if you have ideas, I'll gladly listen.

## Known issues

* Making the window too narrow can break some CSS and make the menu UI ugly.
* The ball opacity options don't work in Firefox.
* Firefox seems to occasionally delete the save file upon closing the tab. If you're playing in Firefox, export your save frequently!

## Archived versions

I plan to archive the last version before any update that significantly nerfs previous content or renders previous save files incompatible, so that the old version is still easily accessible to people who want to keep playing it. Below is the list of archived versions.

* [v0.12.2 beta](https://poochyexe.github.io/pachinkremental/archive/beta_0/pachinkremental.html)

* Fix balls acting weird after being transformed from normal to gold in mid-air by the Overdrive Midas upgrade.
* Adjust gemstone ball description text to mention that they also don't count towards the max balls limit.

### v1.11.0-beta (2021-07-06)
* Add another Overdrive upgrade.
* Bugfix: Check that the corresponding gemstone ball type is unlocked before revealing the Overdrive upgrade for it.

### v1.10.1-beta (2021-07-06)
* Keep the board on-screen when scrolling down, if enough headers are expanded to exceed the height of the screen.

* Add Beach Balls to Bumpers machine.
* Add 3 more Overdrive upgrades.
* Buff: Reduced costs of Overdrive upgrades.
* Fix score multiplier display precision flickering between 1 decimal place and rounding to the nearest integer during a Hyper Combo.

* Remove an extraneous peg in the right wall of the Bumpers machine.

### v1.9.2-beta (2021-06-19)
* Fix point value text on score targets not updating when switching notations.

### v1.9.1-beta (2021-06-11)

* Fix upgrade tooltips sometimes going partially off-screen.
* Make the Hyper Combo counter fade out when the Hyper System activation time runs out.

### v1.8.0-beta (2021-06-06)

* Add stats for highest combo and number of times the Hyper System has been activated.

### v1.7.6-beta (2021-06-02)

* Fix the "New!" notice always appearing in the Upgrades header if it's collapsed when switching machines, even when switching to a machine where none of the upgrades are newly revealed.

### v1.7.5-beta (2021-06-01)
* Buff: Make Bumper Value increase twice as fast after 500, since its cost-effectiveness becomes pretty rubbish in the late game. (It's still pretty underpowered in the late game, just less so.)
* Add stats for points earned in the last 5/15/60 seconds by ball type.
* Fix stats panel displaying "Highest buff multiplier: ×0" when switching machines from Basic to Bumpers.

### v1.7.4-beta (2021-05-30)

	* Increase max Bumper Value and lower the cost of upgrading it.
	* Add upgrades that increase the value of the middle score targets and the bottom slots.

### v1.5.1-beta (2021-05-21)
* Lower prices for Add Score Targets, Gold Ball Rate, and Gold Ball Value upgrades on Bumpers machine.

### v1.5.0-beta (2021-05-19)

	* Buff: Double Ruby ball value increase per second.
	* Add an upgrade that adds 5 more blue score targets.

### v1.4.7-beta (2021-05-18)

* Move the Gold Balls upgrades above Bonus Wheel upgrades in the Basic machine, now that shrinking maxed upgrade buttons means Board, Auto-Drop and Gold Balls upgrades can fit neatly in one row on a standard HD display (1360x768 or 1366x768).

### v1.4.3-beta (2021-05-12)
* Adjust bumper physics so that when a bumper sends a ball flying into another bumper, the ball doesn't ricochet as wildly off the second bumper.

### v1.1.1 (2021-05-03)
* Fix drop zone being drawn 5 pixels too high in April Fools mode.

### v1.1.0 (2021-04-30)
* Add a rotation-based multiplier for beach balls.

### v1.0.0-RC1 (2021-04-11)
* Pachinkremental is out of beta!
* Lots of rebalancing. In order by game progression:
	* Nerf: Lower the max Gold ball rate to 15%.
	* Buff: Raise the max Gemstone ball rates to 10%.
	* Buff: Gemstone and higher ball rate upgrades now increase by 0.2% per upgrade level instead of 0.1%.

	* Nerf: 8-Ball Score Exponent is now an exponent on the 8-Ball's 8x multiplier instead of the gold ball value multiplier.

	* Nerf: Reduced max Beach Ball Score Exponent from 10 to 2.
* New "Congratulations!" modal when you max every upgrade that can be maxed.

### v0.12.1 beta (2021-04-12)
* Fix exploit where Beach Ball timer could be extended by pausing script execution (e.g. minimizing the window or switching away from the tab). Thanks to Leidwesen for the bug report!
* Add scientific notation.
* Fix "Highest buff multiplier" stat showing 1x instead of 2x if the buff hasn't stacked before.

### v0.12.0 beta (2021-04-11)
* Add a couple more upgrades for Beach Balls, aimed at balancing points from the center slot with points from the bonus wheel in the late game.

### v0.11.2 beta (2021-04-11)
* Add more names for numbers up to 10^120.

### v0.11.1 beta (2021-04-11)

	* Fix Beach Ball not applying the 8-Ball's 8x spins.
	* Fix 8-Ball and Beach Ball scoring text not displaying when pop-up text is set to "8-Ball+ only".

### v0.11.0 beta (2021-04-11)
* Change 8-Ball Exponent to be a gradual upgrade, instead of jumping from 3 straight to 8, and rename it to "8-Ball Score Exponent". Note: Importing a save file from a previous version will reset this upgrade's level.
* New upgrades!
	* Synergy upgrades for Topaz, Turquoise, and Amethyst balls.
	* Add 8-Ball Spin Exponent upgrade.
* Refactor a bunch of code to reduce the amount of boilerplate I have to write when adding a new ball type or collapsible section in the upgrades menu.
* Tweak physics engine to detect if a ball is (or about to be) stuck by being perfectly balanced on top of a peg, and give the ball a tiny random nudge. (This was theoretically possible but so incredibly unlikely that I doubt anyone's actually encountered it in normal play. Still, I was able to get a ball stuck by hacking the RNG to return specific values, so better safe than sorry.)

### v0.10.0 beta (2021-04-08)
* New ball type: Beach balls! They're bouncier and floatier than other ball types.
* Add another Bonus Wheel upgrade.
* Add "8-Ball+" choice for pop-up text display option.

* Add 3 new Bonus Wheel upgrades.
* Add a new 8-Ball upgrade.

* Fix classic opal balls option button, which I accidentally broke in v0.8.3. Oops!

### v0.8.4 beta (2021-04-07)
* More UI decluttering, by changing "Unlock X" buttons to remove the "Unlock" once bought. (The grayed-out button remains so that you can still see the tooltip text.)
* Make the save export modal automatically highlight the full save file when you click on the text box. Also tweaked it to look better.
* Bugfix: Clear balls on the board when importing a save file.
* Bugfix: Update buff display when importing a save file that doesn't have a buff active.

### v0.8.3 beta (2021-04-07)
* Fix color of pop-up text for spins earned by 8-Balls.
* Made the upgrade panel UI more compact:
	* Hide "Bought:" counter on upgrade buttons to reduce UI clutter. You can turn them back on in the options if you want.
	* Stop forcing new rows between certain upgrade buttons.

### v0.8.2 beta (2021-04-06)
* Fix score multiplier buff not being applied to points won from spinning the bonus wheel.
* Tweak brightness of grayed-out buttons so they're easier to tell apart from a buyable 8-ball upgrade.

### v0.8.1 beta (2021-04-05)
* Add a hint that says when the next upgrade is revealed.
* Fix a bug where you could upgrade things past their max level by clicking really fast.

### v0.7.2 beta (2021-04-04)
* Fix pegs being too dark to see in dark mode + low quality mode ... except when April Fools is active.
* New effect for Opal balls to make them easier to distinguish from other gemstone balls. You can still use the old style in the options, if you like.

### v0.7.1 beta (2021-04-03)
* New QoL feature: Dark mode! It can be toggled in the options.

### v0.7.0 beta (2021-04-03)
* New upgrade: Make bonus wheel spins play out faster.
* QoL: Add a "New!" indicator that appears when a new upgrade becomes available while the section is collapsed.
* Minor nerf: Bonus wheel ball drops scaling to gemstone ball unlocks are no longer automatic, but need to be purchased as upgrades.

### v0.6.3 beta (2021-04-02)
* Added opacity sliders for each ball type.
* Added the option to keep April Fools' Day mode on all the time.
* Reorganized save file data structure. Note that this means save files exported from this version will not import correctly into older versions -- doing so will reset all your options to defaults. Starting in this version, importing a save from an incompatible future version will fail entirely.
* "Balls dropped manually" stat is now hidden until Auto-Drop is unlocked, since it'll be exactly the same as "Total balls dropped" right above it until then.

### v0.6.2 beta (2021-04-01)
* Optimized performance some more.

### v0.6.1 beta (2021-04-01)
* Happy April Fools' Day! (You can turn the game back to normal in the options.)
* Abbreviate spins earned by sapphire balls in popup text.
* Tweak opal ball coloring to make them easier to distinguish.
* Keep notifications on the top right corner of the window, not the page.

### v0.6.0 beta (2021-03-31)
* Added some upgrades to buff the gemstone balls. (Sapphire's upgrade is significantly cheaper because it was probably the most underpowered previously.)
* Big code refactor. Thanks vadimjprokopev!
* Fixed manual, changelog, and source code links so they open in a new tab.

### v0.5.1 beta (2021-03-31)
* Hopefully fixed the issue that causes the game to start lagging after being open for a while. Thanks a million to /u/Alexandreclalex!

### v0.5.0 beta (2021-03-31)
* New ball type: Opal!
* Buff: Further reduced cost scaling for gemstone ball unlocks.
* Buff: Reduced cost of drop rate upgrades for Topaz, Turquoise, and Amethyst balls.
* Add option to disable some or all pop-up text.

### v0.4.1 beta (2021-03-31)

* Gemstone ball unlocks now reveal themselves earlier.
* Buff: Reduced cost scaling for gemstone ball unlocks.

### v0.4.0 beta (2021-03-29)
* New feature: 6 types of gemstone balls, which have the value multiplier of gold balls plus additional bonuses.

* Various UI tweaks

### v0.3.1 beta (2021-03-27)
* Upgrades are now organized into collapsible sub-sections.

* Add stats for points earned in the last 5/15/60 seconds.

### v0.1.1 beta (2021-03-25)
* Drop zone now fades between red and green.
* Minor rebalancing buffs:
	* Center slot value upgrade cost halved to reduce slog in the early game.
	* Auto-drop and max balls upgrades reveal their existence earlier.
	* Unlocking auto-drop is no longer a prerequisite for upgrading max balls.
