My Star Wars (Stern, 2017) strategy:

# Basic strategy points

* Left ramp is very backhandable.
* Right ramp is *usually* backhandable, but it depends on flipper strength and how steep the machine is set up. Test it out, if it’s backhandable, it’s *much* safer as a backhand.
* Even the Death Star (left loop) is sometimes backhandable, again dependent on flipper strength and leveling. Worth testing out as well.
* On balls 2 and 3, consider picking +5 TIE Fighters, especially if you’re within 5 of a TIE Fighter Hurry-Up. That way you can collect the hurry-up with the ball save still running and mash the button with minimal risk of draining. But if you’ve already destroyed enough TIE Fighters to get the extra ball, +5% Score is often more lucrative.
* Make sure to move your shot multiplier to each shot before you shoot. It helps to plan one extra shot ahead, e.g. instead of just thinking “I’m going to shoot for the left ramp,” I’ll think “I’m going to shoot for the left ramp then the right loop”, then if I hit the left ramp, I use the couple seconds as the ball comes back down to move the shot multiplier to the right loop.
* TIE Fighter Multiball is pretty low-scoring but good for building up your shot multiplier, so I like to use it as a utility multiball.

# Route

Note that this is very much a "go big or go home" strategy, and is not recommended for match play in competition because it doesn't score much in the early game, and there's a risk you might drain out before making it far enough to cash in your board state.

1. Pick R2-D2, on ball 1 pick Light Death Star Missions.
2. Shoot the left ramp 3 times to light Endor missions, then shoot the left ramp one more time to start missions. R2-D2 has only 1 Death Star mission (Rescue the Princess) and 1 Endor mission (Knockout Shield Generator), pick the combination of those two.
3. At this point, if you’re close to TIE Fighter Multiball, go for it. Otherwise focus on completing the missions. Don’t worry about keeping the multiplier going until you’ve started a multiball.
4. Completing those two missions will qualify Destroy the Death Star Multiball and Escape From Endor Multiball. Shoot the left ramp to start them, play Destroy the Death Star Multiball first.
    * The ordering is because playing Destroy the Death Star unlights the Death Star shot, while playing Escape From Endor unlights the left ramp, and the left ramp is the easier and safer shot so you want to keep it lit.
    * In both of these multiballs, shoot the FORCE targets 5 times and the action button will start blinking orange. Hold it down when you’re about to drain out of multiball, and it’ll add another ball *and* give you a couple seconds of ball save, which can save the ball that’s draining if you activate it in time.
5. After this, you should have a good shot multiplier going and some pretty good base values built up, so just milk it for all it’s worth and make sure to hit the TIE Fighter target bank when your green X arrow starts blinking to avoid losing your multiplier. Top priority should be Video Mode if it’s lit, next is Lightsaber Duel, then Hoth mission (light by shooting the right loop 3 times, then once more to start a mission).

Alternate safer route for competitive match play:

1. Pick Han Solo, on ball 1 pick Light Tatooine Missions
2. Shoot the right loop 3 times to light Hoth missions. Play Escape from Mos Eisley, just shoot either ramp then the Death Star to complete the mode without trying to score high on it.
3. Play Escape from Tatooine multiball. As with the R2-D2 strat above, hit the FORCE targets 5 times to light add-a-ball at the action button, use it when you're about to drain out.
4. Try to start the Hoth mission, Navigate the Asteroid Field, with a high shot multiplier. Then play Escape from Hoth, again going for FORCE targets to light add-a-ball.
5. Same as step 5 for R2-D2 above, just replace Hoth missions with Endor missions at the left ramp.
