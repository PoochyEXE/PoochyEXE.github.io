My Foo Fighters (Stern, 2023) strategy:

# Basic strategy points

* First, whenever I shoot the spinner, I'll try to intentionally glance the captive ball to the left of the spinner to get some UFO charges along the way.
  * For that reason, I like to start with New York, because the spinner's always lit.
* **Skill shots strategy:** I like going for the drop targets skill shot to get a free bomb upgrade, after which I'll go for the regular skill shot combo starting at the left crossover. Or if I'm close to starting something valuable such as Austin Multiball, I'll go for the Rock-O-Meter lane skill shot to progress towards 2x playfield.
* **Van mod strategy:** If I have 1-2 drop targets down and the MOD-ulator light is on bomb upgrades, I'll try to complete the targets and go for bomb upgrades. If I have a decent bomb upgrade level, and I haven't played Chicago yet, I like to go for max speaker **and** bomb levels, then Chicago to cash it in. Start Chicago with 8 shots spotted and +2M base shot value, smack that UFO button to spot a 2x shot for about 10M, shoot straight for the final shot at the Overlord for a Bomb + Time Bonus of about 70M. If I'm feeling greedy I might also try to get some engine upgrade levels as well, since engine level 1 adds about 10M to the Time Bonus and each additional level adds another 5M or so.
* **Overlord Multiball strategy:** All My Life multiball isn't very valuable unless you get the Super Jackpot, so I like to stack it with LA instead and use it as a utility multiball.
* **Combotron strategy:** If I have a good combo going, I'll try to extend it *unless* only the side ramp and side loop are lit for Combotron (i.e. the last shot in the combo was the center spinner or the left crossover) or something important is lit at the Overlord (e.g. final shot to complete a city mode, 2x hurry-up in Chicago, etc.) in which case I'll go for the combo collect at the Overlord. Or if I've already collected 3 very good combos, I'll go for the combo collect more to get Combotron Multiball.

# Route

* I like to start with New York, as I mentioned above. I'll largely ignore the higher-value roving shot, since I'm not going for score yet here, I want those UFO charges and mode progress. Center spinner, side ramp to feed the right flipper, repeat until either I have a couple UFO charges or the final shotâ€™s lit.
* From there, the mode I pick at each step depends on whether or not I have 2-3 UFO charges.
  * With 2-3 UFO charges:
    1. Head to Chicago. If the arrow starts flashing rapidly, the 2x is about to time out so I'll smack the button to spot the shot.
    2. If I've already done Chicago, or if I'm 1-2 Overlord hits away from All My Life Multiball, I head to Los Angeles. In LA, the 3 ramps are initially lit, then after you hit one, for a few seconds the shot you hit becomes unlit but the other 2 are lit for 2x. So I make one shot, then go for the combo. If I miss, I hit the button to spot a shot.
    3. Head to Roswell, and smack that UFO button whenever the green arrow reaches the orange arrow.
  * With 0-1 UFO charges:
    1. Head to New Orleans and do spinner -> side ramp combos, again trying to glance the captive ball for UFO charges. Note that the side ramp and side loop count double (when lit) in New Orleans, so on the first combo, I'll hit the spinner, light the second shot on only the spinner, and the (unlit) side ramp shot is mainly to feed the ball back to the right flipper as well as practice for the second combo. Then the second time, I hit the sole lit shot on the spinner, which relights everything else, then I hit the side ramp for the double. Rinse and repeat.
    2. If I've already done New Orleans, I head to Seattle. On Prem / LE, I'll aim for the right ramp on the first shot and try to progress towards Area 51 Multiball. Then I'll try for spinner -> side ramp -> spinner -> side ramp -> left ramp. Note that the spinner won't be lit for the second spinner shot in this sequence -- at that point the side ramp and side loop will be the lit shots, so I'm shooting the spinner both to glance the captive ball for UFO charge and to get the ball to the upper right flipper.
  * Note that you can hold up to 3 UFO charges, and it charges up twice as fast if you're holding 1 or 2. The action button and the insert behind the captive ball light up yellow when you have 1 charge, green when you have 2, and red when you have 3. If you have 1 in stock, depending on the situation you may want to consider holding onto it even if you're in Chicago or LA.
