My strategy for Jaws (Stern, 2024):

# Basic priorities and strategy points

* Prioritize Beachgoers and gear. For gear, Shark Cage is top priority, then Binoculars. Intentionally wait until after Jaws Multiball 1 to get Barrel Hook (unless it’s the last piece of gear, in which case get it and then sell it out immediately) because Jaws 1 isn’t very valuable, you want to save Barrel Hook for Jaws MB 2 or to sell it out. Save the 15th Beachgoer for either ball 3 or after catching Hammerhead Shark, whichever comes first.
* Along the way, if you’re 1 target away from lighting Fish Finder and it’s on Light Video Mode, go for it to lock it in.
* Every time the ball goes to the mini-flipper, trap and go for Fish Finder if it’s lit and you haven’t lit video mode yet, else go for Quickshot. Also go for lighting Fish Finder in the above situation where it’s on Light Video Mode and you’re 1 target away.
* Always try to bash the shark for Encounter Boosts before starting a Shark Encounter. On the 4th and 5th modes I’ll try to Machete it since it’s 20M (4th mode) or 25M (5th mode) base, and ideally by that point I’ll have my base Machete multiplier boosted a bit from completing Shark Encounter modes / Bounty Hunt.
* Also try to hit the shark 3 times during the mode to light gear, particularly during lower value modes (Pond Attack, Night Swim). If you’re running low on time, the 1st hit adds 15 seconds (boat captive ball before starting a mode also spots this shot), and if you definitely can’t complete the mode in time after that, bash the shark to at least light gear.
* Multiball stacking: I like to stack Night Swim with Jaws Multiball 1, and go for the right ramp, center ramp, and left orbit on Jaws MB 1. And I’ll stack Pond Attack with Night Search if I have Fish Finder lit on Night Search, mostly because they’re lower value except for the +1x base Machete if you complete them.
* The slingshots are a bit higher up and smaller than typical. (Should we call these Elwin slings? He did the same thing on Godzilla.) In my experience this makes it easier to trap the ball, but it also makes post passes harder and riskier, so I like to pass by simply shooting the center ramp (right flipper to left flipper) or the right ramp (left flipper to right flipper).

# Full route

First, on ball 1, I soft plunge and try to nick the pop bumper on the right for the skill shot so that it comes back down to the mini-flipper lane, then go for a Quickshot. If the fin pops up on the left or middle, on most copies I can ski pass to the right flipper and backhand it. Regardless of outcome, I’ll intentionally drain if the ball save is still lit, soft plunge before the autoplunger fires, and go for another Quickshot. Sometimes I can even squeeze in a 3rd Quickshot.

Hopefully I hit at least one Quickshot to light gear, but either way, I’ll make one shot to the right ramp to light Bounty Hunt, and collect Shark Cage if I had gear lit. (Right flipper button cycles through available gear.)

Next I’ll hit the boat captive ball to light Shark Encounter, then hit the shark to light encounter boosts. I always go for the encounter boosts, and on the 4th and 5th modes I’ll try to Machete it since it’s 20M (4th mode) or 25M (5th mode) base.

For my first mode, I pick Scars since it’s valuable by itself but stacks poorly with multiballs. Shoot the right ramp to start Bounty Hunt, also picking Binoculars if I have another gear piece lit. I like going for Hammerhead first.

On Prem / LE, in phase 2 of Scars the wheel is lit on the Orca upper playfield, I’ll go for that. I’ll trap the ball and use the action button to stop the wheel on +3X Machete, then try to complete Scars. At the end, when the fin pops up for the Encounter Jackpot, I’ll first shoot the center ramp to feed the left inlane, trigger Machete, and use it on the Encounter Jackpot. It’s usually upwards of 40M base so that’s 200M in one shot if you can pull it off.

Next I’ll go for Beachgoers to get the Beach Closed hurry-ups, first on the center and right ramps, then left orbit. Around this point I’ll usually have Jaws Multiball 1 close to ready, so I’ll try to stack it with Night Swim, and go for those 3 shots.

After that, Beach Panic and combo the center and right ramps back and forth to milk those Beach Closed value boosts for all they’re worth.

Around this point I’m usually a spinner rip or two away from Bounty Hunt Multiball, so I’ll go for that. If I catch Hammerhead, I’ll go for Search Multiball, otherwise I’ll save it for ball 3. In my experience, my average Search is better than my average Rescue, although a really good Rescue is better than a really good Search.

Then I’ll go for Raft Attack and go for the right ramp → center ramp → fin combo, then Pond Attack if I haven’t already played it, to reach Fourth of July.

Make sure to bring Machete into Fourth of July, and use it on the first super jackpot for another 200M or so.

# Shark Hunter (video mode) mini-guide

The Shark Hunter video mode can be quite lucrative with the right strategy -- for me, 75M is pretty meh, 90M is good, and on a good day I can even break 100M. Your basic priorities are getting the extra ball, getting the harpoons that give you 5 more shots, and hitting sharks quickly, in that order.

First of all, pick 3D Enabled. It's easier to see even if you don't have 3D glasses.

Understanding the shark movement and spawn pattern is key. Sharks move along 5 "tracks":

1. Upper left corner to bottom right corner and back, repeating a few times and getting slightly closer each time.
2. Upper right corner to bottom left corner and back, repeating a few times and getting slightly closer each time. The mirror of track #1.
3. Charging straight at you along the left harpoon's trajectory.
4. Charging straight at you along the center harpoon's trajectory.
5. Charging straight at you along the right harpoon's trajectory.

If a shark reaches the end of a track, it attacks you and ends video mode. Note that if you shoot the shark after the attack animation starts, you get the points for it but it still ends your video mode.

On tracks #1 and #2, the shark can spawn anywhere in the upper half of the track, but is always headed towards the lower coner initially. If it spawns close to the center of the screen, you may not have enough time to react to shoot it immediately with the center harpoon, but I find I can usually still hit it with one of the the outer harpoons (right harpoon for track #1, left harpoon for track #2) before it reaches the corner.

Now, at the start of video mode, 2 sharks always spawn immediately on tracks #1 and #2. So the first thing I always do is look for the 2 sharks, aim for whichever one spawns lower down on the screen by using the harpoon on whichever side it's headed, and then aim for the other shark using the harpoon on the opposite side.

The game tries to keep 2 sharks on the screen. When you hit a shark, and *only* when you hit a shark, another shark will spawn after a fixed delay (about half a second). This means that for maximum points, you want to hit the sharks as soon as possible. In particular, on tracks #1 and #2, a shark that reaches the bottom corner will stay there for about 2 seconds, wasting precious time. Meanwhile, the difference between hitting a shark with the center harpoon vs. hitting it with an outside harpoon on the way down is only about a quarter-second, so your priority is to not let sharks reach the bottom corners.

Also, the new shark will never spawn in the same lane as the other shark on screen. Combined with the fact that a shark spawning in tracks #3, #4, or #5 plays the "dun dun dun dun" sound, this means that there will be one shark each in tracks #1 and #2 most of the time, and you can know whenever this changes thanks to the "dun dun dun dun" sound cue.

Putting this all together: Let's say the mode starts with Shark A on track #1 spawning in the middle of the screen (headed towards the bottom right corner) and Shark B on track #2 spawning in the upper right corner (headed towards the lower left corner). The first thing I do is take aim at Shark A using the right harpoon. I'll make one shot, then immediately switch my focus to Shark B and aim for it using the left harpoon. Assuming I hit Shark A, Shark C will spawn around the time when I'm shooting at Shark B, and most of the time it will spawn on track #1. After taking a shot at shark B, if I hear a "dun dun dun dun", then I immediately look for shark C and shoot at it, otherwise I turn my attention to track #1 and aim for shark C using the right harpoon again. This means I can get into a rhythm, alternating my focus between track #1 + right harpoon and track #2 + left harpoon, and the "dun dun dun dun" sound cue tells me when to shift my focus to looking for a charging shark.

Finally, keep an eye on the timer. If I'm down to 3 harpoons and there's still plenty of time left, I'll hold my fire for a bit and only aim for sharks charging straight at me, in hopes of getting a +5 shots harpoon. If I have plenty of harpoons and only about 5 seconds left on the clock, I'll start spamming harpoons indiscriminately to get some extra points from hitting random stuff.
